This Python Library gives you access to the Kickstarter API. 

I've mapped most of the API for the logged in user. This gives you access to
backed projects, starred projects, project updates, notifications, and comments. 

I'm trying to find out how searching works and what functionality is available for
not logged in user. 

I'll try making a more fancy README tomorrow. I just wanted to get this up there.
